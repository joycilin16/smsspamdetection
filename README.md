#SmsSpamDetection 



The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between spam and legitimate SMS messages. 
This task is crucial due to the increasing volume of unsolicited messages that can lead to privacy invasion, financial loss, and other security issues.
The dataset commonly used for SMS spam detection includes labelled messages, indicating whether each message is spam or ham. 
The SMS Spam Collection Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a well-known source. 
Implementing an ML-based SMS spam detection system involves preprocessing text data, extracting meaningful features, and applying suitable algorithms to classify messages accurately.
The success of the model hinges on the quality of the dataset, the effectiveness of preprocessing steps, and the choice of features and algorithms. 
Continuous evaluation and optimization are crucial for maintaining high detection rates and minimizing false positives.
By leveraging machine learning, it is possible to automate and enhance the accuracy of SMS spam detection, 
thus protecting users from unsolicited and potentially harmful messages.
